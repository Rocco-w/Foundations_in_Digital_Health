Description: In this project, we use We used the MRREL table in the UMLS database to find three one-directional cycles. 
             In this project, I start from CUI1 with the most PAR relationship and start looking for the first three 
             one-directional cycles that meet the requirements. Then save the result as a txt file as required. At the
             same time, in this project, I also encountered some difficulties. I completed this project by discussing 
             the idea of the project with Weibin Huang, Yifan Zhang, and Prof. Weisong helping to answer my questions 
             about program logic.
